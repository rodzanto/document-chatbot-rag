    "# Retrieval Augmented Question & Answering with Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we're implementing an architecure called Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG retrieves data from outside the language model (non-parametric) and augments the prompts by adding the relevant retrieved data in context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we explain how to approach the pattern of Question Answering to find and leverage the documents to provide answers to the user questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges\n",
    "- How to manage large document(s) that exceed the token limit\n",
    "- How to find the document(s) relevant to the question being asked\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposal\n",
    "To the above challenges, this notebook proposes the following strategy\n",
    "#### Prepare documents\n",
    "![Embeddings](./images/Embeddings_lang.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before being able to answer the questions, the documents must be processed and a stored in a document store index\n",
    "- Load the documents\n",
    "- Process and split them into smaller chunks\n",
    "- Create a numerical vector representation of each chunk using Amazon Bedrock Titan Embeddings model\n",
    "- Create an index using the chunks and the corresponding embeddings\n",
    "#### Ask question\n",
    "![Question](./images/Chatbot_lang.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the documents index is prepared, you are ready to ask the questions and relevant documents will be fetched based on the question being asked. Following steps will be executed.\n",
    "- Create an embedding of the input question\n",
    "- Compare the question embedding with the embeddings in the index\n",
    "- Fetch the (top N) relevant document chunks\n",
    "- Add those chunks as part of the context in the prompt\n",
    "- Send the prompt to the model under Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "- Get the contextual answer based on the documents retrieved"

    "## Implementation\n",
    "In order to follow the RAG approach this notebook is using the LangChain framework where it has integrations with different services and tools that allow efficient building of patterns such as RAG. We will be using the following tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: Anthropic Claude v1.3 available through Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "  This model will be used to understand the document chunks and provide an answer in human friendly manner.\n",
    "- **Embeddings Model**: Amazon Titan Embeddings available through Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "  This model will be used to generate a numerical representation of the textual documents\n",
    "- **Document Loader**: PDF Loader available through LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "  This is the loader that can load the documents from a source, for the sake of this notebook we are loading the sample files from a local path. This could easily be replaced with a loader to load documents from enterprise internal systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector Store**: It could be any like Amazon OpenSearch, Amazon Kendra (for a fully managed retrieval), or 3rd party alternatives such as Pinecone (available through the AWS Marketplace) or in-memory options like FAISS. All options are available as retrievers through LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In this notebook we are using Pinecone, therefore there is a pre-requisite of creating an account in the Pinecone website and get the API key for using in our case.\n",
    "- **Index**: VectorIndex\n",
    "\n",
    "  The index helps to compare the input embedding and the document embeddings to find relevant document\n",
    "- **Wrapper**: wraps index, vector store, embeddings model and the LLM to abstract away the logic from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "To run this notebook you would need to install some dependencies, and then begin with instantiating the LLM and the Embeddings model. Here we are using Anthropic Claude to demonstrate the use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It is possible to choose other models available with Bedrock. You can replace the `model_id` as follows to change the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "`llm = Bedrock(model_id=\"amazon.titan-tg1-large\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "Available models under Bedrock have the following IDs:\n",
    "- `amazon.titan-tg1-large`\n",
    "- `ai21.j2-grande-instruct`\n",
    "- `ai21.j2-jumbo-instruct`\n",

       " Document(page_content='2 ONLINE GAMING: A GAMBLE OR A SURE BET?\\nA Gamble or a Sure Bet?\\nThe online gaming business is progressively moving into markets around the \\nworld, changing the model of the gambling industry as many consumers turn to the Internet to bet on sports, gamble on slots or play cards. Despite potential political and legislative restrictions, the market, which already produces more than US$20 billion in worldwide revenue,\\n1 may be ready to grow further as new \\ngeographic regions open up and many governments become more receptive to Internet-based gaming.\\nOne attraction of the online gaming market is its very high rate of growth.  \\nH2 Gambling Capital, one of the most widely quoted sources of online gaming statistics, says the market for global interactive gaming will grow about 42 percent to US$30 billion in 2012 from US$21.2 billion in 2008. This is significantly faster than the 15 percent growth that H2 forecasts for the gambling industry as a whole over the same period.\\n2', metadata={'page': 3.0, 'source': 'data/KPMG_OnlineGaming.pdf'})]"
